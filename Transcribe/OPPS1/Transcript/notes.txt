Page 1:
In class,class lab225[sic],Encapsulation is writing a class.
I am writing a simple class called customer,so I am taking one object called Customer
Encapsulating that now,Encapsulation is writing a class called Customer 
And inside a customer what you can do.
Describe something,its state and behaviour
Means you have to declare the variables for recording the state and data and write the methods for implemeting its behaviour.
So what  data you want to store for the customer I want to store
<1>

These four things I want to store about the customer.
This is the state.
Then one operation currently just I am showing the customer data
just printing in the customer data.I am printing in one line format<2>
concatenation also you know:
-------->(cid + "\t" + cname + "\t" + email + "\t" + phone )

I should have a simple class like this save this with the name.(lab225.java)
To test the customer class you have to take the object of customer class.
customer cust = new customer();
With that u can call 
show method cust.show();

calling show method of customer.
Customer class having 4 variables and one method and 1 method.
Crearting customer method,calling show what it will display now.
What is the cid value when memory allocated for cid.what is the value of cid.
cid is integer right what is the value inside cid.=>0
cname=>null]
email=>null
phone=>0
That only will be displayed right,compile and run now.

So what is the use of creating customer object (with the default values)?
No use right if you create a customer object if you will create a customer class object it is allocating memory for
cid
cname
email & phone.

1 Customer data has to be stored in this.
and if I have hundred customers then how many objects required?
Can I store 100 customer data  in 1 customer object.

Page 2:

This is called as state of an object.<1>
This is only one function [pause]behaviour.<2>

You should know that what variables to write what methods to write.
How much data to store so when you describe your entity.

Now when you creating object say

classname variable = new classname.
This is the way to create right.
changes internally if u write this [see RN] 
1 you say 
new Hello is 2
Something like this we discussed somewhere arrays case.

Similar idea.
What happens Hello h?
what is h now?
reference variable of hello class.
reference variable of any class it will take only 8 bytes of memory,default value as null,name is h.
1 is done
2nd new Hello();
what is the use of new operator?
new operator is used to create object?
also we have written another line 
under new operator-- allocating memory for instance variables of the class.
class I have two types of variables.
Instance or Static:
new operator is used to allocate the memory only for the instance variables of the class not the static variables
Whether this two(int a , int b) are instance or static.
So instance variables.
So new operator will allocate.
Whenever you say new and class name,it checks that in this class Hello any instance variabels available or not.
Yes,available,then memory has to be allocated for this,then we take on room here.
In this room,memory will be allocated for "a" memory will be allocated for "b".
How much memory for "a" -->4 bytes because its is integer,b also 4 bytes and default value as 0.
So,all the instance variables got the memory for new.
a has memory at some place,a address is differnt
b address is different now 
what address will be stored in h?
address of the block.
See diag.

Because an object we have lot of elements like this(a,b)
It cannot store multiple addresses here.
So,its creating one big room,in this it will allocate memory for N no of instance variables.
If we have 10 instance variables here it will allocate memory for all 10 instance variables here in one block
That block address will be assigned here[3] i.e. by the (assignment operator).

So,I created one object I have some "a" value and "b" value (a = 10 and b =20)
I got one set of data now.
I want to store this "a" how can I store now?
I created object like this (1a)
I creating object here(1b)
I have to initialize this now.
So you can access the variable of 
h.a = 10, h.b = 20;

So h.a means this "a" changed to 10.
     h.b means this "b" changed to 20.

Now I got another set of data "a" value 100,"b" value 200 
where can I store that now,where can I store this data
Can I store here only,what happens now?
h.a=100 if I say this data will go right,I store this object 
1 set is there right.
Dont disturb this.
I want another (a,b)
I have to store this another object.
Another object is required again you have to create another object
You create another object.
Hello h1 =  Hello();
You create another object now
