Members of class [31 August 6:57]

Binding data and behaviour in class in called Encapsulation.
Binding state and behaviour of an object in one entity is called as Encapsulation.
Or u can say writing a class into variables and methods is also called as Encapsulation.

But data will be hidden inside the class only and methods will be exposed outside.
Inheritance:Using existence class functionality is called Inheritance.
In Polymorphism, one object behaving differently in different situations is called polymorphism.


And 116 page No.We have seen what is a class,what is an object  and how to write a  class,
how to create an object and how to access the members.

Then when you create an object what is happening :
Creating instance, allocating memory for reference variable

And creating object:
Allocating memory for all instance variables of the class(only instance variables of the class),not static.
Assigning object address to refernce variable.
These 3 things happening when you create an object in a given class.

Page No118:
When you write a class,it can contain five types of members:
U can declare 
the variables
write the blocks
add constructors,methods and classes again.
class inside a class.

So class can have five types of members.(variables,methods,blocks,constructors and inner classes)

We will start landing one by one
Will start with the variables

CB 1
<>
What kind of variable a is ??
We can say it is an instance variable,because declared inside the class directly.
and not having the static keyword,so instance variable.
<>
this also instance variable we will make  as static keyword.
So we have one instance variable and one static variable.

I am taking a method <> just printing
