have you ever wondered what happens when someone in England visits the world science festivals webpage first their

computer needs to ask the world science

festival server for a copy of that

webpage the computer sticks this request

into a virtual envelope called the

packet wrapped with specific information

about that request including the world

science festivals IP address the

computer sends this packet out of the

house and below the street via large

underground copper wires it passes

through small regional networks before

ending up here at tella house North in

London tella house north is England's

main internet hub the IP address on this

packet tells the hub that the world

science festival server is actually in

Los Angeles so tella house north sends

the packet out as light across the

Atlantic over fiber optic cables very

deep beneath the ocean the packet ends

up here 60 Hudson Street New York City

the largest internet hub on the EastCoast

this hub sends the packet through a

series of regional networks connecting

New York to Los Angeles where the world

science festival server resides the

server reads the request and gets ready

to send the webpage to England but web

pages made up of images and text are too

large to send us a single packet of data

so how do we get it back to England

imagine a group of 5,000 tourists

visiting New York City in a single

gigantic tour bus they are way up in

Harlem but they want to visit the Statue

of Liberty before it closes

but it's rush hour on a Friday there's

no way that giant bus is going to fit

through those crazy congested streets so

they decide to get off the bus and

spread out some take the subway some

take cabs a few rent bikes and some even

take kayaks down the Hudson River how

they get there doesn't matter as long as

they get there on time

likewise for the internet to work

efficiently this webpage is pulverized

into thousands of tiny packets of data

each one wrapped with all of the

information that needs to rebuild itself

in English the packets are sent to LA is

one Wilshire hub which checks the

traffic report before sending them off

through miles and miles of Lam they

travel checking in through different

hubs like our New York City tourists

those packets don't care how they get

there as long as they get there as fast

as possible most of them will go through

60 Hudson in New York where they are

redirected back to England as light

riding a fibre of glass as thick as a

silver dollar then back on copper wire

through regional British networks until

all the package reached their

destination and and this epic journey it

all happens in about a second along with

trillions upon trillions of similar

journeys that happen each and every day

on this remarkable easy to take for

granted network of networks we call the

Internet
