	/*The problem is why we need these two methods,both the method name is show.
	 * and both are taking the object of phone right,Iphone is a phone and samsung is 
	 * a phone.Then why to create these 2 methods.
	 * What if we create just one method?
	 * But the problem is if we create only one method,what should be the parameter.
	 * To solve this problem we can use something called Abstraction.
	 * Create a abstract class,called Phone in which we create on method,
	 * called public abstract showConfig.
	 * [class Iphone extends Phone] and [class Iphone extends Samsung]
	 * So even if you pass object of Iphone this phone(Phone obj) will be excepted.
	 * You can pass the object of subclass(Iphone and Samsung) in the reference of superclass. 
	 * It is not compulsory to have the abstract method in Abstract Class.
