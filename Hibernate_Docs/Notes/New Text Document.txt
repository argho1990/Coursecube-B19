ORM Tool: Hibernate is something called an ORM tool.
Hibernate is much more than an Hibernate Tool there are much more features that 
have been added over the years.
But when it first started it started as an ORM tool.
It used primarly in the Data Layer of Applications where you want to persist your application 
data to a database.
Implements JPA.(Java Persistence API)
This is a set of standards that have been prescribed for any persistence of implementation that 
needs to met in order to get certified as a Java Persistence API Implementation so that means is that
it follows the rules that have been set in the JAVA Persistence API Specification,so later if you dont
want to use hibernate some other provider which implements the same java persistence API,you can do 
that with minimal code changes.

What is an ORM Tool and why it is required?
What is the problem that hibernate is trying to solve?
