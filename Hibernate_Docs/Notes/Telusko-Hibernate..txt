Hibernate Intro:
If u want to make a software you have to make an object.
It deals with the concept of inheritance,abstraction and polymorphism.
So we talk about all this things when it comes to object.

Now hold on when u want to store a data,so normally you want to store a data.
You might be storing that in a file,which is your txt files.
You might storing your data in xls file.
You might be storing your data in DOC or CSV file.

The problem is if your storing your data in all these formats,its is very difficult to fetch.
very difficult to process.
Dr Chord given those golden rules.
Due to these,we have this concept of relational databases.

So one the one hand we have object model and on the other side we have relational model.
So we process data, we do all those software stuff with the help of objects.
We store our data in a relational part,that means if you are living in this world and if want to connect your 
software or application(s) which work with objects with the relational you have to connect them.
Now is it that simple to connect.

Now we done that before say we have RDBMS which is mysql,and you have Java on this side.
So how do you connect your java and mysql.So we have this concept of jdbc(JAVA DATABASE CONNECTIVITY)
So using this you can connect your Java Applicationa and Mysql.
The problem starts when you want to connect this in an efficient way.
When u say efficient way what it means think about developers now.
Its is my job to write an application and save all those data in the tables.
When you save it,it also means persists.
We also want to achieve persistence.
We want to store our data in the application into the database.
Because in application we use variables,so normallly we store our data in variables,we have to make sure that data goes  
into the table.
In objects we have classes,on the other side,in the relational side we have tables,there we have a concept of fields.


We have variables (RDBMS)on this side we have columns so table-columns.On this side we have objects,(RDBMS)in this side 
we have rows-tuples,Now it is easy to map it right.
We have class, we have table,we have variables,we have fields,but can you implement all those OPPS concept.
  
What about Inheritance,what about polymorphism,how can you achieve that on Tables?
So this people,industry people wanted a mapping tool,where you can map your objects & relational properly.

So thats why we have a concept of ORM?
Object Relational Mapping;
When we say ORM,its just a concept,we wanted an implementation and thats why we wanted an ORM Tool.
So we have a tool which is hibernate.
So we have a tool like JPA,iBATIZ,Toplink.
We have all of these tools and one of the best tool is Hibernate.
So as per the ranking the best tool is hibernate.
Again,there is a big debate on this well.its hibernate 
So if you know hibernate,you can learn the other things as well.
So what hiberanate does is that it does the mapping between the object world and the relatioal world.
